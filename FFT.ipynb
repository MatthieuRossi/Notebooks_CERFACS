    "\n",
    "We notice that the Fourier Transform of a signal is a complex function and its dimension is amplitude.time. When studying the spectrum of a signal, it is common to focus on the amplitude of this spectum. Assuming that the value of the Fourier transform for a certain frequency is $X(f_0)=a+\\mathrm{i}b$ the amplitude is defined as: $A=\\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are computing a signal, we are no more considering a continuous signal but a discrete one. In fact, what we do is to pick the value of the signal regularly, at a determined time step. This method gives us a vector. Thus we must use a discrete version of the Fourier transform defined as follow:\n",

The line of symmetry is at a frequency of $\\text{N}\\Delta f/2$ which marks the Nyquist frequency (one half of the sampling rate). Shannons sampling theorem states that a sampled time signal must not contain components at frequencies above the Nyquist frequency.\n",
    "The frequency resolution is defined as the inverse of the time range. The longer is your time sample, the more precise will be your spectrum.\n",
    "Now, we will create our spectrum analyzer. Spectrum analyzer devices typically represent the Fourier transform in terms of magnitude and phase rather than real and imaginary components. Furthermore, spectrum analyzers typically only show only half the total frequency band due to the symmetry relationship.\n",
