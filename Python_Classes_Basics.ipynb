    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is called the *constructor* of the Point3D class. This method is called exactly once: when the object is first created, *i.e.* when the class is *instantiated*. This means that `cyl` is only computed once from `cart`. If `cart` changes at a later point (or equivalently if `cyl` changes), it will no longer be synchronized with `cart` (resp. `cyl`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forcing coherence in classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects (classes) are meant first and foremost to *hold data*. A class must represent a chunk of data to its user, and is responsible for staying coherent over time, **whatever order the user chooses to call the methods in**. In order to force coherence, object-oriented languages often use *private* variables, which the user shouldn't / can't access. In Python, nothing is ever **truly** private, but a convention is to add `_` before a private attribute or method. A safe Point3D class could look like this:"

It seemed very natural, but of course as we saw it was broken. Nevertheless, because it is natural, users will spend very little time understanding and remembering it. The point of `Point3D_V3` is to keep this usability, but use a bit of dark magic (actually, [*syntactic sugar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)) to make it work in the background."
