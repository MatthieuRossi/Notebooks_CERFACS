    "Studying the frequential behavior of a system is sometimes useful in order to highlight determined instabilities. To do so, it is common to plot the spectrum of a physical parameter (such as pressure, acceleration,... ) using the Fourier Transform.\n",

    "During this tutorial, we will create a periodic signal, then we will introduce a noise. In the end, using the Fast Fourier Transform, we will find out the frequencies of the initial signal and the spectrum of the noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "We notice that the Fourier Transform of a signal is a complex function and its dimension is amplitude.time. When studying the spectrum of a signal, it is common to focus on the **amplitude** of this spectum. Assuming that the value of the Fourier transform for a certain frequency is $X(f_0)=a+\\mathrm{i}b$ the amplitude is defined as: $A=\\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are computing a signal, we are no more considering a continuous signal but a discrete one. In fact, what we do is to pick the value of the signal regularly, at a determined time step. This method gives us a vector. Thus we must use a discrete version of the Fourier transform (DFT) defined as follow:\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{X}_k=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{2\\pi}{N} nk}             , k=0,1,...N-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy library helps you doing this caculation with `numpy.fft.fft()` function. The value returned by this function is a vector of N complex components. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** There are different paradigms to calculate the DFT. The $\\frac{1}{N}$ factor is a normalization that may be applied either on the Fourier Transform (multiplying by $\\frac{1}{N}$), on the inverse Fourier Transform (multiplying by $\\frac{1}{N}$) or on both (multiplying by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ for each operation). Numpy's fft algorithm applies the $\\frac{1}{N}$ factor on the inverse Fourier Transform. We prefer to apply it on the direct Fourier Transform to have an idea of the amplitude of the sine we are looking for, so we will add it in the function we will create hereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A characteristic of the discrete Fourier transform is that the frequency domain is taken from 0 to $(N âˆ’ 1)\\Delta f$. The line of symmetry is at a frequency of $\\text{N}\\Delta f/2$ which marks the Nyquist frequency (one half of the sampling rate). Shannons sampling theorem states that **a sampled time signal must not contain components at frequencies above the Nyquist frequency**.\n",
    "The frequency resolution is defined as the inverse of the time range. The longer is your time sample, the more precise will be your spectrum.\n",
    "#### Amplitude spectrum\n",
    "Now, we will create our spectrum analyzer. Spectrum analyzer devices typically represent the Fourier transform in terms of magnitude and phase rather than real and imaginary components. Furthermore, spectrum analyzers typically only show only half the total frequency band due to the symmetry relationship.\n",
